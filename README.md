<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Update This

### Prerequisites

*You will need to understand how to install and use linux at a basic level.
*You may need to install libraries mentioned below in the installation.
*You will still need a full study guide to take the exam this course only covers about 60% of the material through a real live project. 

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. You need to be able to compile C using the "make" system, this program is designed to be compiled on a mac or linux machine.  If you are on windows for sake of brevity and ease you
will need to install the docker container: [https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/code-server], which may include installing docker. Once you have code-server running and can use your browser to code while running a linux terminal you should be good to go.

2. Clone the github repository to a directory you can access with code-server or if you are on a mac or linux machine.
3. Install the needed libraries on your machine which include GSL and Raylib. 
4. Ensure the make file correctly includes the library directories that were just install.
5. Run make (just the word make in the main directory of the repository where the Makefile is located)
6. Run the application.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

This project was built in collaboration with Physic Students at NCSU. I remain an active participant in the NCSU Friends of the Library program and as such continue to network, learn from, and help mentor students and friends in learning how to code, especially with the C programming language and with Linux and open source systems.
